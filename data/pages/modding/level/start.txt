===== Level Editing =====

A level editor is in active development. Until it's ready, you can use direct UAsset editors like [[https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases|UAssetGUI]].

==== Standalone Level Editing Tools ====

  * [[https://github.com/Lakifume/True-Randomization/releases/|True Randomization Mod]] - Comes with a map editor. You can rearrange rooms, change music.

==== Basic Concepts  ====

All levels/rooms in the game are stored under **BloodstainedRotN/Content/Core/Environment** (this is the extracted folder from the game's **.pak** files).

Each "ACTXX_XXX" folder is an area of the game. E.g. "ACT01_SIP" is the Galleon Minerva level at the start of the game. Underneath the "ACTXX_XXX" folders is a similar setup for each level:

| Blueprint				| Scripts or groups of commonly used model sets across multiple rooms. |
| Dialogue				| Triggers for any NPC conversations in the area. |
| Level					| Defines the placement of everything in each room, 3D models, enemies, etc. |
| Mesh					| 3D models that only appear in a particular area are stored here. |
| MI					| Materials associated to the 3D models. |
| Sequence				| Cutscenes. |
| Textures				| Textures associated to the 3D models. |

If you want to modify the 3D models/textures, [[modding:modelling:start|visit the modelling section]]. This page is for everything else.

==== Room ID Map  ====

This is map helps you find the room IDs so you don't have to guess which files to edit. The text is very small so zoom in.
