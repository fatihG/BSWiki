==== Create a New .pak File From the Newly Packaged .uasset Files ====

I'm going to create a new folder next to my **MiriamHeadUnreal (Unreal Engine Project)** folder, and my **ModelEdits (UE Viewer export)** folder called "FinalPackaging". This is where I'll set up the file structure to generate the new **.pak** file that will serve as the final file that is distributed to everyone as the mod.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_create_pak_make_package_folder.png?nolink&400 |}}

Inside of this "FinalPackaging" folder, create a folder called "BloodstainedRotN". Then open it.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_create_pak_make_bloodstained_rotn_folder.png?nolink&400 |}}

Now in a separate Windows Explorer window, locate the "Cooked" folder you created in the previous step. Navigate to:\\ "Cooked -> WindowsNoEditor -> **//NAME OF UNREAL ENGINE PROJECT FOLDER//**".

In my case, I named the Unreal Engine project folder "MiriamHeadUnreal", so my path is:\\ "Cooked -> WindowsNoEditor -> MiriamHeadUnreal"

Copy the "Content" folder into the "BloodstainedRotN" folder (inside "FinalPackaging").

If you've followed the other tutorial to modify Miriam's nose geometry, make sure you aren't accidentally copying those cooked files over as well. All you want in this folder is the //Content\Core\Character\P0000\Texture\Face\T_Face01_Color.uasset// file.

Now download {{ :modding:tool_unrealpak.zip |UnrealPak}} if you haven't already, and extract it in the folder above the "FinalPackaging" folder.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_extract_unrealpak.png?nolink&400 |}}

Click and hold the left mouse button down on top of the "Final Packaging" folder, and drag it on top of "UnrealPak-Without-Compression.bat". Release the left mouse button.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_drop_folder.png?nolink&600 |}}

UnrealPak will output something like the following and generate a new file called "FinalPacking.pak" in the same folder.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_output.png?nolink&600 |}}

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_generated_file.png?nolink&400 |}}

**Congratulations!** FinalPacking.pak is your mod.

Before you add your mod to Bloodstained's Pak folder, you should give it a filename that assures it will load **after** the main game files load. Bloodstained will load all **.pak** files in alphabetical order, so it would be best if you name it something that comes after "pakchunk" in the alphabet.

Another way to get around this is to create a folder called "~mods" inside of the "Paks" folder, then place your *.pak file inside of that. The tilde ~ character is loaded alphabetically after all other letters by Unreal Engine.

In my case, I'll rename "FinalPacking.pak" to "~MiriamHeadMod.pak", and then copy "~MiriamHeadMod.pak" into Bloodstained's //BloodstainedRotN\Content\Paks// folder.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_final_pak_in_paks_folder.png?nolink&600 |}}

Now start the game and see your texture changes.
