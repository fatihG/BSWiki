==== Create a New .pak File From the Newly Packaged .uasset Files ====

I'm going to create a new folder next to my **MiriamHeadUnreal (Unreal Engine Project)** folder, and my **ModelEdits (UE Viewer export)** folder called "FinalPackaging". This is where I'll set up the file structure to generate the new **.pak** file that will serve as the final file that is distributed to everyone as the mod.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_create_pak_make_package_folder.png?nolink&400 |}}

Inside of this "FinalPackaging" folder, create a folder called "BloodstainedRotN". Then open it.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_create_pak_make_bloodstained_rotn_folder.png?nolink&400 |}}

Now in a separate Windows Explorer window, locate the "Cooked" folder you created in the previous step. Navigate to:\\ "Cooked -> WindowsNoEditor -> **//NAME OF UNREAL ENGINE PROJECT FOLDER//**".

In my case, I named the Unreal Engine project folder "MiriamHeadUnreal", so my path is:\\ "Cooked -> WindowsNoEditor -> MiriamHeadUnreal"

Copy the "Content" folder into the "BloodstainedRotN" folder (inside "FinalPackaging").

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_create_pak_copy_content_folder_over.png?nolink&800 |}}

Now, inside the copy of the content folder, delete all **.uasset** files //except// for the **.uasset** file that contains our modified 3D model. We only needed to set up the skeleton, physics, and materials so the engine can reference them; those **.uasset** files should not go into the final package as they are not set up properly to override the originals.

I'll repeat: **delete all .uasset files containing materials, skeleton, or physics asset**.

In this case, you'll only be left with the **SK_PI01_MiriamHead.uasset** file which is inside of the "FinalPackaging\BloodstainedRotN\Content\Core\Character\P0000\Mesh" directory.

Now download {{ :modding:tool_unrealpak.zip |UnrealPak}} if you haven't already, and extract it in the folder above the "FinalPackaging" folder.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_extract_unrealpak.png?nolink&400 |}}

Click and hold the left mouse button down on top of the "Final Packaging" folder, and drag it on top of "UnrealPak-Without-Compression.bat". Release the left mouse button.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_drop_folder.png?nolink&600 |}}

UnrealPak will output something like the following and generate a new file called "FinalPacking.pak" in the same folder.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_output.png?nolink&600 |}}

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_mesh:tutorial_create_pak_unrealpak_generated_file.png?nolink&400 |}}

**Congratulations!** FinalPacking.pak is your mod.

Before you add your mod to Bloodstained's Pak folder, you should give it a filename that assures it will load **after** the main game files load. Bloodstained will load all **.pak** files in alphabetical order, so it would be best if you name it something that comes after "pakchunk" in the alphabet.

Another way to get around this is to create a folder called "~mods" inside of the "Paks" folder, then place your *.pak file inside of that. The tilde ~ character is loaded alphabetically after all other letters by Unreal Engine.

In my case, I'll rename "FinalPacking.pak" to "~MiriamHeadMod.pak", and then copy "~MiriamHeadMod.pak" into Bloodstained's //BloodstainedRotN\Content\Paks// folder.

Now start the game and enjoy your long nose.
