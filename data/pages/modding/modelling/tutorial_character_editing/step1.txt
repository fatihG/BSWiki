==== Use UE Viewer to Extract Miriam's Body Model ====

Open [[modding:tools#ue_viewer|UE Viewer (umodel_64.exe)]] and open Miriam's body model at "BloodstainedRotN -> Content -> Core -> Character -> P0000 -> Mesh". The package name is "SK_P1000".

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_character_editing:tutorial_character_editing_open_umodel_miriam_body.png?nolink&800 |}}

Export the model to a new folder where you want to edit it.

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_character_editing:tutorial_character_editing_export_umodel_miriam_body.png?nolink&400 |}}

{{ :modding:modelling:tutorial_character_editing:tutorial_character_editing_export_umodel_miriam_body_dialog.png?nolink&600 |}}

In my case, the exported **.psk** file that I'll be editing is located at //X:\BloodstainedMods\CharacterEditing\ModelEdits\Core\Character\P0000\Mesh\SK_P10000.psk//.
