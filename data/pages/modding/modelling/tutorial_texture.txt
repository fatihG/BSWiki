===== Tutorial: Modifying a 3D Model's Texture =====

If you've already created a Bloodstained mod before, download any tools you don't have below then [[.:tutorial_texture:step3|jump to step 3]].

==== Required Modding Tools ====

Before you start, you'll need to download the following tools:
  * [[https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal|Unreal Engine 4]]
  * {{ :modding:tool_quickbms.zip |QuickBMS}}
  * [[https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel|UE Viewer]]
  * {{ :modding:tool_unrealpak.zip |UnrealPak}}
  * [[https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa|PSK/PSA Importer Addon (for Blender users)]]

You will also need to decide which 3D modelling software you'll use to preview the texture while you edit it. This is technically an optional step, but it helps a lot if you can see what you're doing.

If you've never used 3D modelling software before, I recommend learning with **Blender** as it's free. But you can use any 3D modelling software that has the ability to import **.psk** models, including:
  * [[https://www.blender.org/download/|Blender]] with the [[https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa|PSK/PSA Importer Addon Installed]]
  * [[https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/free-trial|3DS Max]]
