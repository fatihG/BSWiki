==== Basic Concepts ====

**Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night** is a game built in Unreal Engine version 4.18.3. Unreal Engine provides a built-in way for developers to update their games after release, we utilize this to mod the game.

**Game Assets** - When I use the word **asset** from this point forward, it means anything the game uses to work - 3D models, animations,  sounds, blueprint scripts, etc. We want to replace these assets during modding.

**.pak files** - Unreal Engine stores all of the game's assets in large files with the **.pak** extension. Bloodstained automatically loads all **.pak** files that are placed inside the //BloodstainedRotN/Content/Paks// folder, in alphabetical order according to the file and folder name. During modding, your ultimate goal will be to create a new **.pak** file which can be placed in this folder in order to override the assets in the game's other pre-existing **.pak** files.

**.uasset files** - A **.pak** file holds multiple **.uasset** files. Each of the game's assets are stored in individual files with the **.uasset** extension. It is possible to store more than one asset in a single **.uasset** file, however it is usually 1 asset = 1 uasset file. A **.uasset** file could hold anything, such as a 3D model or a DataTable that defines weapon stats. Depending on what type of asset you're modifying you will use different tools to extract that asset from the **.uasset** file, modify it, then rebuild the **.uasset** file with the modified asset.

**The basic process for creating any mod is as follows:**
  - Unpack the **.pak** files containing the game's existing assets.
  - In the unpacked directory, locate the **.uasset** file containing the game asset you want to modify.
  - Modify the **.uasset** file depending on what type of asset it is. Pick one of the [[modding:start#topics|categories above]] for tutorials based on what type of asset is being modified.
  - Set up a blank project in Unreal Engine and import the modified asset, package (cook) the project to generate new **.uasset** files.
  - Use one of the modding tools such as [[modding:tools#unrealpak|UnrealPak]] to generate a new **.pak** file that contains your modified **.uasset** files.
  - Copy your new **.pak** file into the game's //Paks// folder.
  - Run the game to test.
