====== Chests =====
>[[start|<Back>]]

I might make a reference list to all the chests later on. But for now, colour logic.

----

===== Colour =====

The different colours represents what you can expect inside:
  * Blue (Materials, Ingredients)
  * Brown (Potions and Bullets)
  * Gold (Plot Item, all 1 of them)
  * Green (Gear and Weapons)
  * Red (Gold)

----

===== How the colour is decided =====

Each chest have a default colour, that can be overruled through different means. Priority: Blue > Red > Green / Brown (Depending on which is placed in RareItemId)

=== Blue ===

> "AreaChangeTreasureFlag": true,

By setting this to true in DropRateMaster file, the chest turns blue, and refresh each time you exit and re-enter the area.

=== Red ===

> "CoinType": "EDropCoin::D10",

Enabling coins makes the chest red. This even works if coin ratio is 0, so that it doesn't actually drop any coins.

=== Green ===

> "RareItemId": "None",
> "CommonItemId": "None",
> "RareIngredientId": "None",
> "CommonIngredientId": "None",

If any of these contains a Gear or Weapon item, the chest turns green.

> "ShardId": "None",

Note that this entry doesn't change colours, even if you do put a gear item there. Even if it has gear in the later slots.

=== Brown ===

> "RareItemId": "None",

Setting this to an item like potion will make the chest brown. Unless otherwise over-written.
