===== Other Problems =====

Some Cut-scenes get stuck if you enter from the wrong side, or other problems/issues with Drop rates:

  * Fight between Gebel and Alfred, between Towers -> Library (When enter from left side, camera leaves screen and gets stuck)
  * If you put **"AreaChangeTreasureFlag": true,"** on a monster, it always drops 1 potion. Might have other side effects or req.
