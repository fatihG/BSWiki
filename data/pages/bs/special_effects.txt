==== Weapons - Status Effects ====
Status afflictions have 3 chance levels:

  * Low: ~30% chance
  * Often: ~50% chance
  * Always: 100% chance

Most weapons have a low chance for affliction.

The exceptions are Kazikli, which often afflicts curse; Swordbreaker, which always debuffs enemy STR; and coin weapons (8/16/32bit).

Coin weapon affliction chances are based on their level:

  * 8bit: Low (~30%)
  * 16bit: Often (~50%)
  * 32bit: Always (100%)

=== Curse ===

  * Hofud ─ Low
  * Kazikli ─ Often
  * Blood Grinder ─ Depends on level

=== Stone ===

  * Kaladanda ─ Low
  * Murgleis ─ Low
  * Gold Cross ─ Depends on level
  * Sculptor's Chisel ─ Depends on level
  * Silent Calamity ─ Depends on level

=== Poison ===

  * Poison Kukri ─ Low
  * Snakebite ─ Low
  * Stinger ─ Low
  * Oleanders ─ Depends on level

=== Debuff enemy STR ===

  * Swordbreaker ─ Always

===== Library Books =====
I added the effects of OD's Library books to the fextralife wiki. Exact stats and required map completion % are listed there.

https://bloodstainedritualofthenight.wiki.fextralife.com/Orlok+Fahrenheit+Dracule+(O.D)

The main takeaways are:

Effects that aren't shown in-game (attack speed, EXP etc) all increase their stat by 20%.

The Tome Of Conquest actually incorporates 4 books, not just 3. The secret book is Tactician's Tome, which gives +20% EXP gain.

  * Carpenter's Key ─ Boss room in Oriental Sorcery Lab: Carpenter
  * Warhorse's Key ─ Boss room in Garden of Silence: Revenant
  * Millionaire's Key ─ Boss room in Hall of Termination: Millionaire’s Bane
