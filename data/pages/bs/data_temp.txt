==== Purple Shards ====

Here is a list of directional shards that are affected by Ambivalence

These were all tested on the bone morte outside of Arrantville.

  * Flame Cannon
  * True Arrow
  * Inferno Breath
  * Chaser Arrow
  * Flying Dagger
  * Teps Oceus
  * Aqua Stream
  * Acid Jet
  * Venom Mist
  * Flamethrower
  * Chisel Barrage
  * Riga Dohin
  * Fald Ciu
  * 8-bit fireball

Some interesting things to note:

  * One thing I noticed was that fire spells did not get an attack boost with the light ambivalence but did get a decrease in attack power when converted to dark
  * Fald Ciu is a dark spell normally but did increased damage when converted to light
  * The two poison shards did more damage by themselves without Ambivalence but the light whip still does more damage than the dark one as expected

==== Red Shards ====

Temp: here's the list:
  * Cerulean Splash
  * Shuriken
  * Upbeat Heat
  * Va Ischa
  * Va Schia
  * Tis Raiff
